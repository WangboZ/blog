Hello world, I'm Wangbo Zheng, a data scientist. After I finished my master's study in electrical engineering and information technology at the University of Stuttgart, I worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Signal Processing and System Theory. During my research projects, I implemented deep learning to energy and medical signal. Since two years ago, I work as a solution expert in an agile team in PlanB. GmbH. I had several projects in the natural language processing and computer vision area. I'm not only a Chinese native speaker, but also I always speak German with my colleagues. In my free time, I often travel and take pictures of beautiful landscapes.
