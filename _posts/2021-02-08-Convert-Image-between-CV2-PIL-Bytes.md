[PIL](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (Python Imaging Library) and [OpenCV](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/) are the most used python libraries for image processing. It is also very common that both two libraries are used in the same project. Therefore, you always need to convert the images between OpenCV and PIL standard. Sometimes you also need the image in binary format, especially when you need to use some Rest API. In this article, I will summarize all these format conversions we need for processing images with Python.

These are the libraries you need to import.

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
```



## PIL vs. CV2

For the grayscale image, you only need NumPy to convert it. But for the color image, we have to do one step extra. Because OpenCV follows the BGR convention but PIL follows RBG convention.

```python
def pil_to_cv2(image):
    '''Convert PIL image to cv2 image
        Args:
            image: PIL opened image
        Returns:
            image: CV2 format image
    '''
    image = np.array(image) 
    if len(image.shape)==3:
        image = image[:, :, ::-1].copy() 
    return image
```

```python
def cv2_to_pil(image):
    '''Convert cv2 image to PIL format 
        Args:
            image: CV2 opened image
        Returns:
            image: PIL format image
    '''
    if len(image.shape)==3:
        image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
    image = Image.fromarray(image)
    return image
```

In the `pil_to_cv2` function we use the NumPy to rearrange the order of color channels. In `cv2_to_pil` we use the CV2 function `cvtColor` to do it. If you forget to convert the order of color channels you might get an image like the right one in the picture.

## Bytes and Buffer

When you use `open()` with the image file path, you will get a file object buffer with `_io.BufferedReader` or `_io.BytesIO` type. Then we can use the read method to get the binary format of the image. 

Normally we will open an image with the following code.

```python
image_path = "lenna.jpg"
with open(image_path, 'rb') as f:
    image_bytes = f.read()
# or    
image_bytes = open(image_path, "rb").read()
```

Try following code you will get: `_io.BufferedReader` and `bytes`

```python
print(type(open(image_path,'rb')))
print(type(open(image_path,'rb').read()))
```

With the following code, you can convert bytes back into `_io.BytesIO` type.

```python
bytes_buffer = BytesIO(image_bytes)
```

## PIL vs. Bytes

To convert bytes to PIL image we only need to add `BytesIO` in the PIL `Image.open()` method.

```python
def bytes_to_pil(image_bytes):
    '''Convert image bytes to PIL image
        Args:
            image_bytes: image bytes
        Returns:
            PIL image
    '''
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(image_bytes))
    return image
```

To convert a PIL image to bytes without storing, we also need `BytesIO()` to help us. However, we need to specify a format such as JPEG. In the following example, we used JPEG format. There are also two parameters we can set to guarantee quality: quality and subsampling. 

```python
def pil_to_bytes(image):
    '''Convert PIL format image to byte with JPEG format
        Args:
            image: PIL opened image
        Returns:
            JPEG format bytes
    '''
    buf = io.BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG', 
                quality = 100, subsampling = 0)
    image_bytes = buf.getvalue()
    return image_bytes
```

## CV2 vs. Bytes

To convert image bytes to CV2 image is more complicated than to PIL. First, we need to convert bytes to NumPy array with method `frombuffer`. Then, the function `imdecode` reads the image from the specified buffer array in the memory.  

```python
def bytes_to_cv2(image_bytes):
    '''Convert image bytes to CV2 image
        Args:
            image_bytes: image bytes
        Returns:
            CV2 image
    '''
    image_array = np.frombuffer(image_bytes)
    image = cv2.imdecode(image_array, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    return image
```

The function `imencode` from CV2 encodes an image into a memory buffer. It will return a Boolean `retval` which shows whether the operation is successful, and a buffer which is the encoded image in a one-dimension NumPy array. As mentioned above, we also need to give an image extension/format. In the example, we use `.jpg`.  

```python
def cv2_to_bytes(image):
    '''Convert CV2 format image to byte with jpg format
        Args:
            image: CV2 image
        Returns:
             image bytes with jpg format
    '''
    retval, buffer = cv2.imencode('.jpg', image)
    image_bytes = buffer.tobytes()
    return image_bytes
```

üìù If your image is with .png extension. It might cause errors, because PNG has one color channel more.
